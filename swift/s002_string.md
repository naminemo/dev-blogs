## 好用的字串功能

#### 字串插值
```swift
let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."
```

#### 三個雙引號
```swift
let quotation = """
        Even though there's whitespace to the left,
        the actual lines aren't indented.
            Except for this line.
        Double quotes (") can appear without being escaped.

        I still have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit.
        """

```
